Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits

Given an array nums of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [12,345,2,6,7896]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
12 contains 2 digits (even number of digits). 
345 contains 3 digits (odd number of digits). 
2 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits). 
6 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits). 
7896 contains 4 digits (even number of digits). 
Therefore only 12 and 7896 contain an even number of digits.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [555,901,482,1771]
Output: 1 
Explanation: 
Only 1771 contains an even number of digits.

Solution-
class Solution(object):
    def findNumbers(self, nums):
        fr=[]
        for i in nums:
            count = 0
            while i != 0:
                i //= 10
                count += 1
            fr.append(count)
        co=0
        for i in fr:
            if i%2==0:
                co+=1
        return(co)
