Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences

A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.
You are given an array of strings sentences, where each sentences[i] represents a single sentence.
Return the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.

Example 1:
Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
- The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
- The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
- The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.
Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.

Example 2:
Input: sentences = ["please wait", "continue to fight", "continue to win"]
Output: 3
Explanation: It is possible that multiple sentences contain the same number of words. 
In this example, the second and third sentences (underlined) have the same number of words.

    def mostWordsFound(self, sentences):
        fin=[]
        for i in sentences:
            co=0
            for j in i:
                if j==" ":
                    co=co+1
                else:
                    pass
