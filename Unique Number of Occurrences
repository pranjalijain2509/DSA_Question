Unique Number of Occurrences
Given an array of integers arr, return true if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique, or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,2]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
Output: true

Solution-
class Solution(object):
    def uniqueOccurrences(self, arr):
        freq={}
        for i in arr:
            if i in freq:
                freq[i]+=1
            else:
                freq[i]=1
        fr=[]
        for i,j in freq.items():
            fr.append(j)
        a=len(set(fr))
        b=len(fr)
        
        if a==b:
            return True
        else:
            return False
