1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer
Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.
Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10

Example 2:
Input: head = [0]
Output: 0
 
Constraints:
The Linked List is not empty.
Number of nodes will not exceed 30.
Each node's value is either 0 or 1.

Solution-
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def getDecimalValue(self, head):
        st=""
        cur=head
        while cur!=None:
            if cur==None:
                return None
            st+=str(cur.val)
            cur=cur.next
        return int(st,2)
