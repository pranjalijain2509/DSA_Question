326. Power of Three
Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false.
An integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n == 3x.

Example 1:
Input: n = 27
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: n = 0
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: n = 9
Output: true
 
Constraints:
-231 <= n <= 231 - 1

Solution-
class Solution(object):
    def isPowerOfThree(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        return n > 0 and (3**19) % n == 0
