Single Number
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1

Solution-
class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        freq={}
        for i in nums:
            if i in freq:
                freq[i]+=1
            else:
                freq[i]=1
        for i,j in freq.items():
            if j==1:
                return(i)
        
Success
